<p> <h2> Here are a few easy examples of how I teach my juniors class.</h2> </p>
<p>This series is done in a lunge position with the arms stretched, building strength and endurance. It is an invigorating posture that releases negativity through methodical breathing. Warrior I and II are ideal for beginners. Make this fun exercise. You can scream and call warrior cries and play with swords and armor.</p>

<p>This is said to create emotional balance, and releasing your back muscles will massage your digestive organs. When you teach your child these simple poses, you can play with the animal theme. Boo if your back is hollow and meow if you have your back bool.</p>

<p>This pose offers a great part, when releasing tension in your neck and back. Again - play the animal theme and bark with a wagging "tail", which further helps stretch the leg muscles.</p>

<p>This balancing pose develops mind-body awareness, improves posture and relaxes the mind. A child may find it challenging to have balance on one foot, so that it will encourage him to put his foot that is comfortable. It can be propped on the floor, at the opposite ankle or under or above the opposite knee. Extending the arms also helps maintain posture.</p>

<p>Children are attracted to this fun, crazy attitude that opens the hips. It reorientates the spine and calms the mind. Encourage your child to rock back and forth in this posture, this action provides a soft back massage.</p>

<p>We call this the "Sleeping posture". With this attitude we usually end a yoga class and stimulate deep breathing and meditation. You can place a warm, wet washcloth over your child's eyes, play relaxing music, or give a short foot massage while they rest.</p>
