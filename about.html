<p>
	I started teaching Yoga after travelling in India and found it to be relaxing and beneficial to my body.
	I wanted to share this experience with others.  I have now been teaching for 5 years and enjoy it a lot.
	I hold the highest certification awarded by Yoga Alliance UK. After I studied under the great Swami Niralananda Giri at the Sivananda yoga centre, Kerala, I remain true to my traditional Yoga roots.
  I teach with humour and ease, and my classes vary from challenging and dynamic, creating a practice that detoxifies and restores the body and mind, to simple and unique allowing you to flow in each position gradually.
	With my BA in Pysiotherapy and other qualifications in nutritional therapy, my approach to fitness is holistic and intelligent and I'm always happy to answer any questions you have about your yoga, Pilates, nutrition or fitness regime.
</p>


<p>
	The connection of yoga and the inner self is key, and this is why I run retreats and workshops. </p>

	<p> This allows you to learn the core values of yoga and the best practise it provides us. </p>

	<p> We will give ourselves breathing space to step away from the hustle and bustle of our everyday lives. </p>

 	<p> To find a deeper connection to self, to renew and restore our energy. </p>

	<p> This special retreat will allow you to come and be free, to grow, learn, flourish, laugh, explore, and most importantly rest. </p>

	<p> This journey will be perfect to rejuvenate, to give yourself attention and permission to recharge so you. </p>

	<p> Feel lighter, more energised and will enhance that platform to elevation. </p>
